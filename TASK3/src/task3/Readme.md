# 📚 Library Management System (OOP Project)

## 📌 Overview

* This project is a simple Library Management System developed in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
It allows basic management of Books and Users, with functionality for issuing and returning books.

* The project demonstrates key OOP principles:
    - Abstraction
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism

## 🎯 Objectives
* Understand and apply OOP concepts in Java.
* Create multiple classes (Book, User, Library) with relationships.
* Implement features like book issue and return.
* Gain hands-on experience with real-world system modeling.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* Java (JDK 8+)
* VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
* Terminal / Command Prompt

## 🚀 Features

* ✔️ Add books to the library
* ✔️ Register users
* ✔️ Issue books to users
* ✔️ Return books

* ✔️ Apply OOP concepts (Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation)

*** Sample Usage: ***
```java
📚 === LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ===
1. 📖 Display All Books
2. 👥 Display All Users
3. ➕ Add New Book
4. 👤 Add New User
5. 📥 Issue Book to User
6. 📤 Return Book from User
7. 🔍 Search Book by ISBN
8. 👀 View User's Issued Books
9. 🚪 Exit
Enter your choice (1-9): 1

📚 === ALL BOOKS IN LIBRARY ===

```


## 📖 Example Flow
* Add a few books and users.
* Issue a book to a user.
* Check available books.
* Return a book.
* Observe how OOP concepts are applied in the background.



## Outcomes
* ✅ Outcome: By completing this project, you will gain a solid understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java and real-world system design.
