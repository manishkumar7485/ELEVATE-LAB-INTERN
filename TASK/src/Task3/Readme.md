# 📚 Library Management System (OOP Project)

## 📌 Overview

* This project is a simple Library Management System developed in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
It allows basic management of Books and Users, with functionality for issuing and returning books.

* The project demonstrates key OOP principles:
    - Abstraction
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism

## 🎯 Objectives
* Understand and apply OOP concepts in Java.
* Create multiple classes (Book, User, Library) with relationships.
* Implement features like book issue and return.
* Gain hands-on experience with real-world system modeling.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* Java (JDK 8+)
* VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
* Terminal / Command Prompt
